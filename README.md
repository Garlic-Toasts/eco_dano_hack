<h2 align="left">❓ Research question</h2>
<p align="left">How are firm characteristics interrelated with the involvement of this company in the process of “greening” production?</p>

<h2 align="left">💭 Hypothesis</h2>
<p align="left">The level of concern a business has for the environment depends on its size and the type of interaction it has with its customers:</p>
<p align="left">❗️ B2c businesses and large companies are more environmentally conscious compared to b2b businesses and small companies.</p> 

<h2 align="left">🧑🏻‍🔬 Research steps</h2>
<p align="left">1) Choose valuable columns</p> 
<p align="left">2) Preprocess the data</p>
<p align="left">3) Create a method to evaluate ecological companies</p> 
<p align="left">4) Find correlations</p> 
<p align="left">5) Present the results</p> 

<h2 align="left">🏁 Final results</h2>
<p align="left">✅ Part of the hypothesis about the relationship between company size and its eco-index was confirmed</p> 

<p align="left">❌ Part of the hypothesis about the relationship between the type of company (b2b/b2c) and its eco-index was refuted: there is practically no relationship between them. In addition, b2b companies turned out to be more environmentally friendly</p>
